# CPSC-490-Final-Submission

Hello! Unfortunately, due to the nature of this project, I cannot share a public GitHub repository link because it directly contains private test cases for CPSC 323, and will (hopefully) be used in the future as the class's autograder. 

If you are Professor Park, Professor Lim, Rachel Liang, or some other person affiliated with CPSC 490 and need to see the project code, please email me at tyler.norsworthy@yale.edu and I can add you as a collaborator on the repository.

If you are working on this autograder in the future and it is well past May 2025, please feel free to delete this repository, as it has no more use.

If you are a random Yale student perusing the computer science senior projects page, hello! Best of luck in CPSC 323. Or good job completing it! It's a doozy. But I did it, and so can you (or so did you)!
